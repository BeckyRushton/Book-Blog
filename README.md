The aim of this personal project is to create a functioning book blog using react by incorporating my foundational skills in html, css/scss and vanilla JS.

What I want in the blog:

- Nav bar with links to favourite books, TBR list, blog posts, links to socials
- Title section of blog with tagline
- Intro to me/about section with link to social page
- Main section that has a carousel of favourite books - links to the book overview and my review and most recent blog post and link to blog post page
- Bookshelf with books added on shelves with an add button (when clicked, allows you to add from an array of completed books you have logged already)

I can access google books api for book cover images, dates, extra info:

Theme ideas:

- Light and airy colours/fonts/containers
- Pastels and natural imagery
- Bugs dotted around page (book worm)

To-dos

- Set up links between all pages (and back buttons/home button)
- Style each page
- Add a blog post and favourite books to test out front page
